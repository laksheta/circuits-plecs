# circuit-plecs - Space Vector PWM

This folder contains a PLECS simulation for **Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM)**.  

<!-- ---

## Key Components
- **Sinusoidal Reference Signal**: A low-frequency sine wave.
- **Carrier Signal**: A high-frequency triangular signal.
- **PWM Generation**: Logic to compare the reference and carrier, generating the appropriate PWM signal. -->
